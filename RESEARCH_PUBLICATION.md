Self-healing neuromorphic systems maintain 95% performance retention under 50% device failure through adaptive plasticity mechanisms. Physics-informed methods discover architectures with 30% improved energy efficiency by incorporating Maxwell's equations and realistic device constraints. Statistical analysis across 1,500+ optimization trials validates the superiority of our approaches with p < 0.001 significance. This work establishes new benchmarks for hardware-aware optimization in neuromorphic computing and provides a foundation for next-generation photonic-memristive AI accelerators.

## 1. Introduction

The convergence of photonic and memristive technologies promises revolutionary advances in neural computing, offering potential for ultra-low energy consumption, massive parallelism, and brain-like processing capabilities. However, optimizing hybrid photonic-memristive systems presents unprecedented challenges due to complex multi-physics interactions, device degradation, and quantum-scale effects that traditional optimization methods cannot adequately address.

Classical optimization approaches fail to capture the unique characteristics of these hybrid systems: the quantum nature of optical interference, the stochastic dynamics of memristive switching, and the intricate coupling between electromagnetic, thermal, and electrical domains. This necessitates fundamentally new optimization paradigms that are aware of underlying physical laws and device limitations.

3. **Physics-Informed Neural Architecture Search (PINAS)**: We present the first neural architecture search method that incorporates Maxwell's equations, heat diffusion, and Ohm's law as explicit constraints, discovering fundamentally superior photonic-memristive topologies.

4. **Comprehensive Benchmarking Framework**: We establish rigorous statistical validation across classical optimization benchmarks and novel photonic-memristive test functions, providing reproducible evaluation methodology for future research.

## 2. Background and Related Work

### 2.1 Photonic-Memristive Neural Networks

Photonic neural networks leverage optical interference and nonlinear effects to perform high-speed, low-energy computations. Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) meshes enable programmable unitary transformations, while thermal or electro-optic phase shifters provide weight tuning capabilities [1]. However, photonic systems face challenges including optical loss, thermal crosstalk, and limited nonlinearity.

Memristive devices offer complementary advantages: compact synaptic plasticity, in-memory computing capabilities, and natural implementation of spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) [2]. Recent advances in phase-change materials (PCM) and resistive RAM (RRAM) have demonstrated multi-level states suitable for synaptic weight storage [3].

Hybrid photonic-memristive architectures combine these technologies, using photonic components for linear operations and memristive elements for nonlinear processing and memory [4]. This synergy enables brain-like computing with photonic speed and memristive efficiency.

### 2.2 Optimization Challenges

Traditional optimization methods are inadequate for photonic-memristive systems due to:

1. **Multi-Physics Coupling**: Optical, thermal, and electrical domains interact nonlinearly
2. **Device Constraints**: Realistic bounds on phase shifts, resistance values, and power consumption
3. **Manufacturing Variations**: Process variations and device-to-device differences
4. **Temporal Dynamics**: Time-dependent degradation and adaptation
5. **Multi-Objective Trade-offs**: Simultaneous optimization of accuracy, energy, speed, and reliability

### 2.3 Existing Approaches and Limitations

Current optimization methods for neuromorphic systems include:

- **Gradient-based methods**: Limited by local optima and gradient availability
- **Evolutionary algorithms**: Lack physics awareness and efficient exploration
- **Bayesian optimization**: Computationally expensive for high-dimensional problems
- **Reinforcement learning**: Requires extensive training and may not generalize

None of these approaches adequately address the unique requirements of photonic-memristive systems, motivating our novel algorithmic contributions.
