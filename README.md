# PhoMem-CoSim
PhoMem-CoSim bridges the gap between photonic neural networks and memristive synaptic weights, providing the first open-source joint optical-electrical simulator with differentiable device models. As photonic AI chips increasingly adopt phase-change materials (PCM) and memristive crossbars, this tool enables end-to-end optimization.
